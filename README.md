# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Kickstarter campaign analysis intended to inform Louise's approach to theater funding

### Executive Summary
- Louise is interested in leveraging Kickstarter to crowdsource funding for a theater project
- Using publicly-available data via Kickstarter, we analyzed comparable situations and outcomes to inform Louise's approach
- Successful campaigns for plays in the U.S. had 52.2% lower goals on average ($5,049 in successful campaigns vs $10,554 in failed campaigns) but delivered significantly higher averge pledges ($5,602 vs $559).  This indicates that the idea that is being sold is important to the campaign's success.

### Theater Category Results
- From 2009 - 2017, theater camapigns launched in summer months apper to deliver the most successful outcomes
- Of all parent categories, theater campaigns delivered the highest absolute number of successful campaigns (839), but music campaigns had a higher success rate (77% vs 60% for theater) based on comparing successful campaigns to total (successful, failed, cancelled, live)

#### Theater projects are the largest Parent Category, but also deliver more failed campaigns than other categories

### Recommendation
- Conduct further analysis on the specific subcategory for the market in which you intend to launch as U.S. play analysis may be too broad to draw specific insights
- Carefully consider the size of the campaign goal to ensure that it is enough to meet the project's needs, but not so large as to deter contributions
- Focus on messaging and content - a more compelling message appears to be more important than the size of the goal
